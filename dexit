  obj.__id__       -> integer
  obj.object_id    -> integer

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Returns an integer identifier for obj.

The same number will be returned on all calls to object_id for a given
object, and no two active objects will share an id.

Note: that some objects of builtin classes are reused for optimization.
This is the case for immediate values and frozen string literals.

BasicObject implements __id__, Kernel implements object_id.

Immediate values are not passed by reference but are passed by value:
nil, true, false, Fixnums, Symbols, and some Floats.

  Object.new.object_id  == Object.new.object_id  # => false
  (21 * 2).object_id    == (21 * 2).object_id    # => true
  "hello".object_id     == "hello".object_id     # => false
  "hi".freeze.object_id == "hi".freeze.object_id # => true
